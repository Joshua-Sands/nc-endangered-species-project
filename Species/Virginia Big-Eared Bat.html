<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
<p>As its name suggests the Virginia big-eared bat has long ears measuring at around 2.5 cm. The total body length measures 98 mm. Depending on the age of the bat its fur can be light to dark brown. The Virginia big-eared bat looks much like Rafinesque's big-eared bat but Rafinesque's big-eared bat has gray and white fur. The two bats do not overlap in range (Service).</p>

<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
<p>Throughout the U.S. this fish can be found in the states of   Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, however more specific to North Carolina it can be found in <a href="Avery.html">Avery</a>, <a href="Caldwell.html">Caldwell</a>, and <a href="Watauga.html">Watauga</a> counties. (Service).</p>
<p>These bats can be found in limestone caves that they use for hibernating and maternity roosts. However, in Kentucky, they researchers found a summer colony roosting on a sandstone structure suggesting that they do not limit themselves to only using limestone caves (Johnson).</p>
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
Like other endangered bats the Virginia big-eared bat is often disturbed by humans during hibernation season (Johnson). Each disturbance uses up some fat reserves making harder and harder for these bats to survive the winter months.
