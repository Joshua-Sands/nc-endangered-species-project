<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
<p>The Spruce-Fir Moss spider is a type of tarantula, measuring at 2.5 - 3.8mm. There are no markings on this spider butthey are different shades of brwon including light brown, yellowish-brown, and reddish-brown (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).</p>

<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
<p>Throughout the U.S. this spider can be found in the states of North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Specifically in North Carolina they can be found in <a href="../County/Avery.html">Avery</a>, <a href="../County/Buncombe.html">Buncombe</a>, <a href="../County/Caldwell.html">Caldwell</a>, <a href="../County/Haywood.html">Haywood</a>, <a href="../County/Jackson.html">Jackson</a>, <a href="../County/Mitchell.html">Mitchell</a>, <a href="../County/Swain.html">Swain</a>, <a href="../County/Watauga.html">Watauga</a>, and <a href="../County/Yancey.html">Yancey</a> counties (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).</p>
<p>This spider lives in Spruce-fir forests on moss mats that grow on rocks. The Spruce-fir forests can be found at high elevations on mountains and is made up of Fraser fir and Red spruce trees. The moss mats that they live on have to have an exact amount of moisture. They cannot be too dry because the spider is very sensitive to dry up, but, at the same time they cannot be too wet as large water drops can be deadly (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).</p>
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
The Spruce-fir moss spider is very sensitive to its environment. Destruction of the moss mats it lives can exterminate entire populations of these spiders. Removal of vegetation that shade these moss mats can cause the moss mats to dry up, thereby, causing the spider to dry up. Non-native insects in the area can easily kill the Fraser fir which is a major part of the local ecosystem. Finally the Spruce-fir forests that these spiders live in also face other threats such as storms, fire practices, logging, air pollution, and climate change (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).
