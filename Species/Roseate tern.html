<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This bird is mostly white with the exception of a black cap on the head and light-gray wings. During mating season a rosy tinge appears on the front of the bird. The tail is forked shape. This bird measures about 40 cm in length (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).</p>

<h3>Habitat and Location</h3>
<p>In North Carolina they can be found in <a href="../County/Carteret.html">Carteret</a> and <a href="../County/Dare.html">Dare</a> counties. However, they also live in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Virginia. Roseate terns like to nest on barrier islands and like many other birds migrate south for the winter (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).</p>

<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3>
Today the population for the Roseate tern ranges from about 2,500 to 3,300 individuals. The original population decline was due to overhunting for their feathers credited to the hat industry. Today coastal development of barrier islands pose a major threat to the bird's population. If a Roseate tern feels threated it will abandon the colony as well as any chicks or eggs which become victims of predators (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).
