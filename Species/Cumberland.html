<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
<p>The shell of the Cumberland bean is an oval shape. Females tend to be more rounded and larger than the males growing to about 55 mm. The shell's color can be olive green, yellowish brown, or even black with rays of dark green or black. Unless the shells are clean the rays are not easily seen (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).</p>
<p>The Cumberland Bean looks extremely similar to the purple bean (also an endagered species) to the point that they were once thought to be different varients of the same species. The species differation was vaildated when they did morphological testing on the larva and DNA analysis (Jones, 2016). </p>
<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
<p>The Cumberland bean is located in five different states; Alabama , Kentucky , North Carolina , Tennessee , and Virginia. It only occupies one county in North Carolina, <a href="../County/Cherokee.html">Cherokee</a> county (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).</p>

<p>They are often found in small rivers in gravel and/or sand (Services). Historically they lived in the Cumberland river basin (Jones, 2016).</p>
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
Habitat loss and pollution from run off are the factors that have led to the decline of the Cumberland bean (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016). The damage done to this species  is so bad that taking them out of the wild and reintroducing them at a later date is being considered (Jones, 2016).
