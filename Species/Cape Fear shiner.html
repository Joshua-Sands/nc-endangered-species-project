<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
The Cape Fear Shiner is a type of minnow and because of this does not grow to be very big with a length ranging from 45 to 65mm. They have gold scales with a black strip in the middle and a white under belly. The scales are outlined in black. During mating season the males become even more golden in color while the females take on a silvery color. During this time the males will grow small round bumps called tubercles on the upper portion of their body (NC Wildlife Resources).
<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
<p>The Cape Fear Shiner is located only in North Carolina in <a href="Chatham.html">Chatham</a>, <a href="Harnett.html">Harnett</a>, <a href="Lee.html">Lee</a>, <a href="Moore.html">Moore</a>, and <a href="Randolph.html">Randolph</a> counties (Services).</p>

<p>Since its original discovery the Cape Fear Shiner has lost much of its historical range. Today there are only five known populations located in the Cape Fear River basin. The fish is often found in riffles, shallow runs, and slow pools with  gravel, cobble, and boulder substrates. Vegetation such as the American water willow will make great habitat for the Cape Fear Shiner (Hewitt).</p>
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
The main reason the population decline of the Cape Fear Shiner would be habitat loss. insularization, creating islands, also seem to be a major contributing factor. Due to their now limited range they are hit extremely vulnerable to different dangers such as chemical spills, droughts, floods, and reduced water quality (Hewitt).
