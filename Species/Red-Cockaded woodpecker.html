<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
Standing at 18 to 20 cm tall and with a wingspan of 35 to 38 cm, the red-cockaded woodpecker has a black back with white strips. Its head is covered in a black cap and males have a red strip the goes along the side of this black cap (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).
<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
<p>The red-cockaded woodpecker can be found throughout the southeastern U.S. In particular it can be found in the North Carolina counties of found in <a href="../County/Anson.html">Anson</a>, <a href="../County/Beaufort.html">Beaufort</a>, <a href="../County/Bertie.html">Bertie</a>, <a href="../County/Bladen.html">Bladen</a>, <a href="../County/Brunswick.html">Brunswick</a>, <a href="../County/Camden.html">Camden</a>, <a href="../County/Carteret.html">Carteret</a>, <a href="../County/Chatham.html">Chatham</a>, <a href="../County/Columbus.html">Columbus</a>, <a href="../County/Craven.html">Craven</a>, <a href="../County/Cumberland.html">Cumberland</a>, <a href="../County/Currituck.html">Currituck</a>, <a href="../County/Dare.html">Dare</a>, <a href="../County/Duplin.html">Duplin</a>, <a href="../County/Edgecombe.html">Edgecombe</a>, <a href="../County/Forsyth.html">Forsyth</a>, <a href="../County/Gates.html">Gates</a>, <a href="../County/Greene.html">Greene</a>, <a href="../County/Halifax.html">Halifax</a>, <a href="../County/Harnett.html">Harnett</a>, <a href="../County/Hertford.html">Hertford</a>, <a href="../County/Hoke.html">Hoke</a>, <a href="../County/Hyde.html">Hyde</a>, <a href="../County/Johnston.html">Johnston</a>, <a href="../County/Jones.html">Jones</a>, <a href="../County/Lee.html">Lee</a>, <a href="../County/Lenoir.html">Lenoir</a>, <a href="../County/Montgomery.html">Montgomery</a>, <a href="../County/Moore.html">Moore</a>, <a href="../County/Nash.html">Nash</a>, <a href="../County/New Hanover.html">New Hanover</a>, <a href="../County/Northampton.html">Northampton</a>, <a href="../County/Onslow.html">Onslow</a>, <a href="../County/Pamlico.html">Pamlico</a>, <a href="../County/Pender.html">Pender</a>, <a href="../County/Pitt.html">Pitt</a>, <a href="../County/Richmond.html">Richmond</a>, <a href="../County/Robeson.html">Robeson</a>, <a href="../County/Sampson.html">Sampson</a>, <a href="../County/Scotland.html">Scotland</a>, <a href="../County/Tyrrell.html">Tyrrell</a>, <a href="../County/wake.html">Wake</a>, <a href="../County/Washington.html">Washington</a>, <a href="../County/Wayne.html">Wayne</a>, and <a href="../County/Wilson.html">Wilson</a> counties (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).</p>
<p>The bird prefers to live inside the trees of the southeastern pine ecosystem. It will find older pine trees, preferably that are infected with fungus to make the bark soft. They will then drill a hole into the tree and will nest there with four other non-mating birds during breeding season. Most compete for existing drilled out trees because creating burrows within the trees is actually rare (Finseth, 2016).</p>
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
Due to changes in the amount of wild-fires and destruction of the long-leaf pine ecosystem, these birds are losing the trees that they use for homes. Because of this, their populations have become highly fragmented. Their excavations are used by at least 27 different species in the ecosystem, so they are a critical species to protect. Currently, fire management practices are being used to help preserve the forests that the red-cockaded woodpeckers call home (Finseth, 2016).
