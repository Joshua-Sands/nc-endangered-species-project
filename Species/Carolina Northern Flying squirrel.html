<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
This mammal has brown fur on its back that turns to white fur as it reaches the belly. It looks a lot like the southern flying squirrel except that the Carolina Northern Flying squirrel is larger by about a third of its body mass. Like most flying squirrels they have folds of skin that allow them to glide. The folds extends from their wrists to their ankles (Services).
<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
<p>In North Carolina the Carolina Northern Flying Squirrel can be found in <a href="Avery.html">Avery</a>, <a href="Buncombe.html">Buncombe</a>, <a href="../index.dwt">Caldwell</a>, <a href="../index.html">Graham</a>, <a href="haywood.html">Haywood</a>, <a href="../County/Haywood.html">Henderson</a>, <a href="Jackson.html">Jackson</a>, <a href="../County/Haywood.html">McDowell</a>, <a href="Mitchell.html">Mitchell</a>, <a href="../County/Jackson.html">Swain</a>, <a href="Transylvania.html">Transylvania</a>, <a href="Watauga.html">Watauga</a>, and <a href="Yancey.html">Yancey</a> counties. It can also be found in  Tennessee and Virginia.</p>

<p>The Carolina Northern Flying Squirrel is a subspecies of Northern Flying Squirrel. So like most Northern Flying Squirrels they like to live in moist, cool forests at high elevations. They are typically found on hardwood trees (Services).</p>
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
The Carolina Northern Flying Squirrel has had its natural habitat segmented into eight remaining areas. This has led to a decline in their population and reconnecting these areas to each other is one of the most important things in order to help this species bounce back (Loeb).
