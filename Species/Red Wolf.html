<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
<p>The Red wolf has mostly brown fur with black fur going down its back and red fur that can be seen around the legs, neck, and behind the ears. An adult weighs about 20-36 kg, is 66 cm in height, and is 122 cm in length (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016). They are often mistaken for coyotes.</p>

<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
Wild Red wolves live in the woods of the following NC counties; <a href="../County/Beaufort.html">Beaufort</a>, <a href="../County/Dare.html">Dare</a>, <a href="../County/Hyde.html">Hyde</a>, <a href="../County/Tyrrell.html">Tyrrell</a>, and <a href="../County/Washington.html">Washington</a> counties.The population located within the five counties make up about 50 individuals. There are also 200 more individuals currently living in captivity (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
When European settlers first came to America they over hunted the red wolf. Additionally, with mates becoming harder and harder to find, the red wolves started to mate with coyotes. Eventually, Red Wolves were taken out of the wild and captive bred. They were re-released in an area of North Carolina where there were thought to be no coyotes. Coyotes did eventually find thier way to the area, but fortunately the red wolves did manage to create a sustainable population. Today red wolves face similar threats to when the European settler first arrived because people think they are coyotes and shoot them (or shoot them on purpose). The hybridization with coyotes is  a threat that is still prevalant today. There are many people who believe that red wolves are pests and would like them taken out of the wild (Red Wolf Revial, 2015).
