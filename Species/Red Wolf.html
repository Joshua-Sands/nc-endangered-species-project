<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
<p>The Red wolf is mostly brown fur with black going down its back and red fur that is seen best at the legs, neck, and behind the ears. An adult weighs about 20-36kg, is 66cm in height, and 122cm in length (Service). They are often mistaken for coyotes.</p>

<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
Red wolves live in the woods of the following NC counties; <a href="Beaufort.html">Beaufort</a>, <a href="Dare.html">Dare</a>, <a href="Hyde.html">Hyde</a>, <a href="Tyrrell.html">Tyrrell</a>, and <a href="Washington.html">Washington</a> counties (Service).
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
Orginally when European settlers first came to America, like many animals at the time, they over hunted the red wolf. Additionally with mates becoming harder and harder to find, the red wolves started to hybridize with coyotes. Eventually Red Wolves were taken out of the wild and captive bred. Eventually they were re-released in an area of North Carolina where there were thought to be no coyotes. Coyotes did eventually find thier way to the area but fortunately the red wolves did manage to create a sustainable population. Today red wolves face similar threats with people thinking they are coyotes and shooting them (or shooting them on purpose) and because of hybridization with coyotes. There are many people who believe that red wolves are pests and would like them taken out of the wild again (Red Wolf Revial).
