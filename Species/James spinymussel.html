<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
<p>The adult James spinymussel is less than 76 mm with a dark brown shell and growth rings. They may have short spines on the shell but this is usually restricted to juveniles. Younger specimens will have a yellow shell (James River Association, 2016).</p>

<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
<p>In North Carolina they are found in <a href="../County/Caswell.html">Caswell</a>, <a href="../County/Rockingham.html">Rockingham</a>, and <a href="../County/Stokes.html">Stokes</a> counties. They arealso found in Virginia and West Virginia. To be more specific, they live in the James River and the Dan and Mayo river systems within the Roanoke River (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).</p>

<p>The river in which they live have a slow current. It is essential that the river is clean otherwise its feeding tube becomes clogged and the mussel starves to death (James River Association, 2016).</p>
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
One of the major reasons the James spinymussel is endangered is because of water pollution such as extra sediments and agricultural runoff. It is also being outcompeted by an invasive species known as the Asiatic clam. Current efforts are underway to reintroduce the mussel back into the wild (James River Association, 2016).
