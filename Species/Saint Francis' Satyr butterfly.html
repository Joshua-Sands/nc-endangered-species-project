<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
Saint Francis' Satyr Butterfly has a wingspan of around 34 - 44mm. It is a brown butterfly with eye-spots on the lower portion of the wings (Service).
<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
It is only located in North Carolina in <a href="Cumberland.html">Cumberland</a> and <a href="Hoke.html">Hoke</a> counties. It likes to live in the Sandhill area in wet meadows (Service).
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
This extremely rare butterfly has lost much of its habitat due to eradicating beavers and suppressing fires both of which are required in order to make a perfect Saint Francis' Satyr butterfly habitat. Also due to how extremely rare it is there is a threat of poaching from collectors. It has gotten to the point where exact colony sites are kept secret and revealed only to other researchers. Otherwise there is a good chance it would be poached to extinction (Service).
