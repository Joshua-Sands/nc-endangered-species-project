<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
<p>Before the Gray Bat goes through its summer molting it is a chestnut brown color. After it molts the Gray Bat stays true to its name and is gray in color with a darker colored belly. The membrane of the wing connects to the foot at the ankle. It is easily confused with other bats in the mouse-eared bat family. Unlike other mouse-eared bats it has a single color on its back and its wing's membrane does not attach to its toes (NatureServe, 2016).</p>
<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
<p>Across the United States it can be found in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. In North Carolina the Gray bat can be found in <a href="../County/Buncombe.html">Buncombe</a>, <a href="../County/Haywood.html">Haywood</a>, <a href="../County/Madison.html">Madison</a>, <a href="../County/Swain.html">Swain</a>, and <a href="../County/Transylvania.html">Transylvania</a> counties (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).</p>

<p>The Gray Bat can be found roosting in caves. These bats have separate caves for summer and winter and will migrate between the two. When not found in caves they can be found over rivers or lakes while they feed (NatureServe, 2016).</p>
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
The Gray Bat suffered their declines due to human disturbances in their caves. These declines were then amplified by other threats such as impounding waterways, cave commercialization, flooding, and pesticides (Sasse, 2016).
