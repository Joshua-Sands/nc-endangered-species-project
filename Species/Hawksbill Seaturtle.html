<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
The shell of the hawksbill is 0.8-1.0 meters and they weight anywhere from 45 to 90 kg when fully grown. They are one of the smaller types of sea turtle. Even though they are smaller they have thicker plates on their shell than most sea turtles. The top of the shell is dark brown with yellow streaks while the underside is yellow. This turtle has a hooked beak which is where they get the name "hawksbill" from (Services).
<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
Being an ocean dwelling species the Hawksbill sea turtle can be found all over the world, however, in North Carolina it can be found in <a href="Beaufort.html">Beaufort</a>, <a href="Brunswick.html">Brunswick</a>, <a href="Carteret.html">Carteret</a>, <a href="Currituck.html">Currituck</a>, <a href="Dare.html">Dare</a>, <a href="Hyde.html">Hyde</a>, <a href="New Hanover.html">New Hanover</a>, <a href="Onslow.html">Onslow</a>, <a href="Pamlico.html">Pamlico</a>, and <a href="Pender.html">Pender</a> counties (Services).

<p>Hawksbills migrate between the beaches they use for nesting and their feeding areas which can include coral reefs.</p>
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
Hawksbill's population has declined over 80% when compared to historical numbers. Due to this better management practices have been introduced that include but are not limited to planting native beach vegetation, protecting from predators, and moving nests in danger of being drowned by tides (Ditmer).
