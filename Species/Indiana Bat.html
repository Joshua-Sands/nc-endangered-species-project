<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
The Indiana bat's fur can come in different shades of  brown and black. The species tends to have a wing span that ranges from nine to eleven inches. The bat is known to have small ears and can often be found in large groups while they are hibernating (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).
<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
<p>In North Carolina the Indiana Bat can be found in <a href="../County/Cherokee.html">Cherokee</a>, <a href="../County/Graham.html">Graham</a>, <a href="../County/Haywood.html">Haywood</a>, <a href="../County/Rutherford.html">Rutherford</a>, and <a href="../County/Swain.html">Swain</a> counties. It can also be found in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Kentucky , Michigan , Mississippi , Missouri , New Jersey , New York , North Carolina , Ohio , Oklahoma , Pennsylvania , Tennessee , Vermont , Virginia , and West Virginia (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).</p>

<p>During the winter the bats like to hibernate in caves. Caves should be around 10&deg;C when they arrive for the winter and drop down to a range of 3-6&deg;C during mid-winter (Clawson, 2001). During the summer they like to roost in forest areas under trees that are either dead or dying (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).</p>
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
<p>There are a few different reasons that may contribute to the endangerment of the Indiana Bat. Human disturbances, such as people waking up the bats while walking around in the caves,  cause bats to use up fat that they stored for hibernation. A single disturbance could cost the bat 68 days' worth of fat. Gates put on caves have also been contributed to their endangerment by blocking the bats from hibernating and changing the climate of the cave so they can't survive hibernation. Finally the use of pesticides on insects, the main food source of this bat, is believed to be affecting them (Clawson, 2001).</p>
