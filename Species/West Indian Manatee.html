<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
<p>The West Indian Manatee is broken up into two sub-species, however, they both have a similar appearance. They are typically a gray color but can also be black to light-brown. The body shape is much like a large seal with a paddle shaped tail. The average adult is 200 kg and 3 meters in length. The face is covered in many whiskers (Service).</p>

<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
<p>The manatee can be found throughout the eastern side of the western hemisphere. To be more specific for North Carolina they can be found in <a href="Beaufort.html">Beaufort</a>, <a href="Bertie.html">Bertie</a>, <a href="Brunswick.html">Brunswick</a>, <a href="Camden.html">Camden</a>, <a href="Carteret.html">Carteret</a>, <a href="Chowan.html">Chowan</a>, <a href="Craven.html">Craven</a>, <a href="Currituck.html">Currituck</a>, <a href="Dare.html">Dare</a>, <a href="Hyde.html">Hyde</a>, <a href="New Hanover.html">New Hanover</a>, <a href="Onslow.html">Onslow</a>, <a href="Pamlico.html">Pamlico</a>, <a href="Pasquotank.html">Pasquotank</a>, <a href="Pender.html">Pender</a>, <a href="Perquimans.html">Perquimans</a>, <a href="Pitt.html">Pitt</a>, <a href="Tyrrell.html">Tyrell</a>, and <a href="Washington.html">Washington</a> counties. Manatees can be found in both fresh and salt waters. During the winter they will search for warm waters because of this power plants built on the water releasing heat are a popular place for manatees (Service).</p>
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
The West Indian manatee faces two types of threats. The first would be from direct human contact including being struck by boats and other water vehicles, getting tangled in fishing line, and be crushed in water control structures. The later would be from indirect human contact such as propellers destroying the grass beds that they feed on and reducing water quality (Deutsch).
