<h3>Description</h3><p /> 
<p>The West Indian Manatee is broken up into two sub-species, the Florida manatee and the Antillean manatee; however, they both have a similar appearance. They are typically a gray color but can also be black to light-brown. The body shape is much like a large seal with a paddle shaped tail. The average adult is 200 kg and 3 meters in length. The face is covered in many whiskers (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).</p>

<h3>Habitat and Location</h3><p />
<p>The manatee can be found throughout the east coasts of countries in the western hemisphere. In North Carolina they can be found in <a href="../County/Beaufort.html">Beaufort</a>, <a href="../County/Bertie.html">Bertie</a>, <a href="../County/Brunswick.html">Brunswick</a>, <a href="../County/Camden.html">Camden</a>, <a href="../County/Carteret.html">Carteret</a>, <a href="../County/Chowan.html">Chowan</a>, <a href="../County/Craven.html">Craven</a>, <a href="../County/Currituck.html">Currituck</a>, <a href="../County/Dare.html">Dare</a>, <a href="../County/Hyde.html">Hyde</a>, <a href="../County/New Hanover.html">New Hanover</a>, <a href="../County/Onslow.html">Onslow</a>, <a href="../County/Pamlico.html">Pamlico</a>, <a href="../County/Pasquotank.html">Pasquotank</a>, <a href="../County/Pender.html">Pender</a>, <a href="../County/Perquimans.html">Perquimans</a>, <a href="../County/Pitt.html">Pitt</a>, <a href="../County/Tyrrell.html">Tyrell</a>, and <a href="../County/Washington.html">Washington</a> counties. Manatees can be found in both fresh and salt waters. During the winter they will search for warm waters. Manatees will can often be found around power plants because of the heat the power plants release into the water (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016).</p>
<h3>Reasons For Endangerment</h3><p />
The West Indian manatee faces two types of threats. The first is direct human contact, which includes being struck by boats and other water vehicles, getting tangled in fishing line, and being crushed in water control structures. The second is  indirect human contact such as the sea grass beds that they feed on being destroyed by propellers and reducing water quality (Deutsch, 2003).
