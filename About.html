<h3><u>Why Protect Endangered Species?</u></h3>
<p>Protecting an endangered species can be costly and time consuming, so why try?</p>
<ul><img src="pics/red wolf3.jpg" height="205" alt="Red Wolf" align="right" style="padding:20px;" />
<li>Well for starters there is the intrinsic value of the creature. They are cool to look at, are used as teaching tools (such as teaching the alphabet), and can be an important cultural symbol depending on the species.</li> <br/>
<li>Many of the species in danger are going of going extinct are in this position because of things we as humans have done to them directly or indirectly. For example we over hunted Red Wolf to the point where it is today or looking at most sea turtles who are threatened by population in the water and coastal development.</li><br/>
<li>Some species offer valuable ecosystem services for free. Mussels can help clean pollutants out of the water, bats help keep insect populations down.</li><br/>
<li>Some have other things to offer. Many different species have been used for multiple medical breakthroughs. Others can be used for agriculture.</li><br/>
</ul>
<p>There are many other reasons to protect endangered species, however, if these different creatures die out then all of these possible advantages are gone with them. Extinction is forever, once they are gone, they are gone for good.</p>
